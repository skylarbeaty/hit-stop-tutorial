# hit-stop-tutorial

This is a project that goes along with a tutorial on youtube

It is an example of how to implement the hit-stop effect into Unity.

You can clone the project, or if you'd rather, the most relevent code is in:
HitStopExample/Assets/Scripts/Crate.cs
HitStopExample/Assets/Scripts/HitStop.cs
