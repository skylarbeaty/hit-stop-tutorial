# hit-stop-tutorial

This is a project that goes along with a [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C949ILsyywg)

It is an example of how to implement the hit-stop effect into Unity.

You can clone the project, or if you'd rather, the code is in the [Scripts folder](HitStopExample/Assets/Scripts) and you'd be looking for [HitStop.cs](HitStopExample/Assets/Scripts/HitStop.cs) and [Crate.cs](HitStopExample/Assets/Scripts/Crate.cs)
